      <h1>VasAR</h1>

      <p class="p1">
        In 2019, I worked on the VasAR project as an AR researcher in the Computer Graphics and User Interfaces (CGUI) Lab at Columbia University. Many AR and VR applications require users to manipulate virtual objects—for example, to perform 3D geometric transformations—typically using tracked hands or hand-held controllers. But in scenarios where a user’s hands are already engaged in a primary task, this setup forces them to pause, switch focus, and then reengage with the original task (e.g., putting down and picking up tools).
      </p>
      <p class="p1">
        To avoid this kind of manual overload in an AR system designed to assist surgeons, we developed a hands-free method for performing 3D transformations on patient-specific virtual organ models. The system combines small head motions for first- and zero-order control with voice commands to specify the type of transformation.
      </p>
      <p class="p1">
        To evaluate the effectiveness of this hands-free method for translating, scaling, and rotating 3D models, we conducted a within-subject study comparing it to a conventional manual technique. Both systems ran on a Microsoft HoloLens and used identical voice commands to set the transformation type. Excluding any task-switching time, users were significantly faster overall with the hands-free method—especially for translation and scaling—and faster (though not significantly) for rotation. The study was published in
